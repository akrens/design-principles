     <h1>Movement</h1>
       <h2> Textbook Definition</h2>
     <p>Movement is about controlling the eye's flow through the page. Lines are a good way to accomplish this (whether this is achieved through literal lines, or leading lines in images).</p>
       <h2> My Definition </h2>
       <p> Movement is about controlling the viewer's eyes, so they see the design in intended manner, and focus on the intended elements. Leading lines are incredibly powerful, and should be a major consideration of your design. </p>

     <figcaption>The diagonal leading line formed by the horses in this postcard is an example of movement.

       <h2>In summary</h2>
       <p> Movement is controlling where the reader's eye does.</p>
