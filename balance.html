     <h1>Balance</h1>
       <h2> Textbook Definition</h2>
     <p>Balance is about creating designs with "equal weight".</p>
     <p>Balance can be radial, symmetrical, or asymmetrical. Radial balance requires that a design can be cut in half in any direction while maintaining symmetry, and is traditionally used for spiritual meanings. Symmetrical balance, also known as formal balance, requires that a design can be cut in half in one direction and be roughly equal on both sides, and is a fairly traditional design style. Asymmetrical balance means the design is not symmetrical at all, however if one were to cut a line at a particular point in the design, the visual weight of the design would be equal on the two sides </p>
       <h2> My definition</h2>
       <p> Balance is all about making your design feel ordered. Too much stuff in any one space makes things feel chaotic and claustrophobic.</p>
